### What I learned

While working on building a recipe menu, I picked up a few key insights along the way. One of the most valuable things I learned was the balance between visual appeal and functional organization. Structuring content in a way thatâ€™s easy to navigate, while keeping the design clean and user-friendly, was a crucial part of the process.

Another aspect that stood out was the importance of consistency in styling. Ensuring that the recipe cards, buttons, and navigation followed a cohesive theme helped maintain a polished look. Additionally, working with images and text alignment brought new challenges, especially when dealing with responsiveness across different devices.

Lastly, thinking about user interaction, such as how users search or filter through the recipes, opened up a lot of room for improving the overall user experience. Implementing these interactive features required careful planning to ensure smooth performance and ease of use.
